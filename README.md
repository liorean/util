# Some utility code
## UTF-8
A simple piece of code that can encode a unicode character in a ecmascript string or a unicode code point in a uint32 as a UTF-8 Uint8Array, and can decode an array of uint8 representing UTF-8 code units into a uint32 unicode code point.
## Inspect Iterables
When developing iterables/iterators/generators or collections, it can be very useful to watch what they do in their current form. This allows you to do that, though with the caveat that it will exhaust the iterator, so if it is infinite it will blow up.
## Iteration tools
A set of functions and generators that could be usefuil.
